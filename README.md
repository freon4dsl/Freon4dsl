# Freon, previously know as ProjectIt
Projectional Editor for the Web. The current release (version 0.5.0) can be found on npm.

## What is Freon

Freon is a TypeScript/JavaScript framework to create and implement projectional editors for Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). 
Additional to the core framework, there are generators for many parts of the work environment for your DSL.

For more information see the <a href="https://www.projectit.org">Freon/ProjectIt</a> website.

## Developing Freon

The main prerequisites are: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
We are typically using the latest versions of both, although older versions likely work just as well.
You could also try and use NPM instead of yarn.

Clone or fork this github project, check out the `development` branch, and install lerna:
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:projectit-org/ProjectIt.git
  yarn global add lerna
```
Setup the lerna structure:
```bash
  yarn bootstrap
```

Now you can build Freon with:
```bash
  yarn build
```

Choose one of the projects in playground. Note that not all of them will work correctly (it is a playground :-)). 
Generate the code for that project (we have choosen the 'example' project):
```bash
  cd packages/playground
  yarn install-example
  yarn example
```

To start the projectional editor for the choosen language in the playground package,
do two things in separate terminals:

Go to directory `packages/server` and start the server:
```bash
    cd packages/server
    yarn start
```

Goto the playground directory `packages/playground` (or stay there if you are already there) and start Freon:
```bash
    cd packages/playground
    yarn dev
```   
This will open a browser with the example from the playground package on 
the URL displayed: `http://localhost:5000/`. The example and all other projects in playground are
work in progress.

## Source organisation

The source code for Freon is organised into the following packages.

* *docs*: documentation, i.e. this website
* *packages/core*: framework source code.
* *packages/core/src/editor*: the editor framework source code.
* *packages/core/src/language/decorators*: source code for <a href="https://mobx.js.org/" target="_blank">MobX</a> decorators that can be used to easily implement a language that can be
  directly used by Freon.
* *packages/meta*: source code that reads the language definition files and generates the language environment.
* *packages/meta/src/languagedef*: source code that generates code from a language structure definition (*.ast*) file.
* *packages/meta/src/editordef*: source code that generates code from an editor definition (*.edit*) file.
* *packages/meta/src/scoperdef*: source code that generates code from a scoper definition (*.scope*) file.
* *packages/meta/src/typerdef*: source code that generates code from a typer definition (*.type*) file.
* *packages/meta/src/validatordef*: source code that generates code from a validator definition (*.valid*) file.
* *packages/playground*: source code generated from the language definition files.
* *packages/playground/src/webapp*: a copy of *packages/webapp*, for use within the playground.
* *packages/playground/src/example/defs*: the language definition files for the example language called 'Example'.
* *packages/server*: source code for a minimalistic model-server used for demonstration purposes.
* *packages/webapp*: source code for the web-application used for all generated languages.
* _/*_: the usual suspects.
