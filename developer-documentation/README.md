# Information for Freon Developers

In this folder you can find various files that describe part of the Freon repository that will
help you to understand where and how to change and augment the Freon documentation.

We suggest that you start with understanding the structure of the repo, and then follow up with 
one of the 'how-to' guides.

Thanks for your efforts and support.
