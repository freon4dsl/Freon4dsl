// This file is included to ensure that tsc does strict checks + emits declarations.
// Rollup only bundles JS (no type checks) and bundles the declarations separately.
// This is done to avoid Rollup to perform checks that are not in line with the checks
// in the tsconfig. It also supports faster builds, and produces clean artifacts:
// ESM JS and a single .d.ts.
