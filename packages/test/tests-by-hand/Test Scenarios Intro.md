# Test Scenarios Intro

In this folder test scenarios that should be performed by hand are gathered. Starting 
with scenarios for model and unit manipulation in the webapp, the tests drill down into the
various parts of the editor (implemented in core/core-svelte).

There are also test webpages in the core-svelte package, which should also be checked.
