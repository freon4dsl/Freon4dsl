= Installing and Using ProjectIt

Be sure to have link:https://nodejs.org/[node.js, window=_blank] and link:https://yarnpkg.com/[yarn, window=_blank]
running. We are typically using the latest versions of all,
although older versions likely work just as well.
You could also try and use link:https://www.npmjs.com/[NPM, window=_blank] instead of yarn.

There are two ways to start with ProjectIt, either use our
xref:example[Example project] or use our xref:template[Template project].

[[example]]
== Start with the Example Project
The simplest manner to start working with ProjectIt is to clone the example project from github.
In the following the root of your project will be indicated with '~'.

*   Clone branch `master` from link:https://github.com/projectit-org/ProjectIt-example[https://github.com/projectit-org/ProjectIt-example, window=_blank].
(For an explanation of the content of the project see xref:code-organisation.adoc[source code organisation].)

*   Next, install all necessary packages by running: +
    `yarn install`

*   Run the generator and see the generated files appearing in the folder ~/src/picode: +
    `yarn generate`

*   Start the server (note that anything that is saved in the editor will be stored in ~/modelstore): +
    `yarn model-server`

*	Open another (bash) terminal, and start the generated editor from it: +
    `yarn start`

+
This command opens your preferred browser with the generated editor for the language `Entity` on
`link:http://localhost:3000/[http://localhost:3000/, window=_blank]`. If Chrome is not
your preferred browser, please open the above page in Chrome, because we cannot
ensure that the editor functions as it should in other browsers.
+
We are sorry to say that webpack is usually slow, particurlarly around 10% of the inital
building. Don't worry, just wait a bit longer.

*   Try out the editor
+
If you are
having trouble using the editor, have a look at the key-bindings under the *Help* menu.

[[template]]
== Start with the Template project
Another way to start working with ProjectIt is to clone our template project from github. The template project provides
a shell for the generated editor that enables the user to work with multiple models and
xref:../intro/modelunits.adoc[model units].
In the following the root of the project will be indicated with '~'.

*   Clone branch `master` from link:https://github.com/projectit-org/ProjectIt-template[https://github.com/projectit-org/ProjectIt-template, window=_blank].
(For an explanation of the content of the project see xref:code-organisation.adoc[source code organisation].)

*   Next, install all necessary packages by running: +
    `yarn install`

*   Create a folder for your language in `~/src`, to hold the definition files for your language.
We usually call it _defs_, but any name will do. (Here the name _defs_ will be used.)

*	Create a language definition file which defines the structure of your language. The
extension of this file must be `.ast`. You can, for instance, copy
`EntityLanguage.ast` from the ProjectIt example to your own `defs`-folder. Or, you can follow the
tutorial on xref:../second-level/langdef-tutorial.adoc[language structure definition].
+
To start with, you only need to define the language structure,
defaults will be generated for the editor, scoper, typer, and validator.

*   Next, adjust the `scripts` entry in the _package.json_ file. The `generate`
script should include your _defs_ folder and the folder where you want the generated code to be stored.
In the following screenshot, we use `~/src/defs` and `~/src/picode`, respectively.

*   Run the generator and see the generated files appearing in the folder where you
decided to store the generated code (in the screenshot we use `~/src/picode`): +
    `yarn generate`

*   Adjust the configuration of the web application by changing the two lines in the file
`~/src/webapp/WebappConfiguration.ts`.

*   Start the server (note that anything that is saved in the editor will be stored in `~/modelstore`): +
    `yarn model-server`

*	Open another (bash) terminal, and start the generated editor from it: +
    `yarn start`

+
This command opens your preferred browser with the generated editor for your language on
`link:http://localhost:3000/[http://localhost:3000/, window=_blank]`. If Chrome is not

== Next steps
Now you are ready for a closer look at ProjectIt. You can for instance:

* Have a look at how the example language is defined by browsing through the language definition
files in the ProjectIt Example project. You can find them in `~/src/defs`,
* Or, follow our xref:../second-level/tutorials-intro.adoc[tutorials] to create your own language,
* Have a look at the xref:./code-organisation.adoc[source code organisation] of the generated project,
* See what the different options are for calling the xref:./commandline.adoc[ProjectIt generator].
