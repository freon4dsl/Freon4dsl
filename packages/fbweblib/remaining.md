# What still needs to be done in the fb webapp

- rename model => changes in core/server
- rename unit => changes in core/server?
- undo
- redo
- cut and copy often select too large an element
- goToNode should go to the part of the node where the search string is
- element search - also without name?

- [Done] interpreter on node Lesson6/Fractions101/InDepth1 does not yield a result: 'Data is being loaded...' is shown.

## Issues in core and core-svelte

- selection of elements: not to property but whole element
- keyboard shortcuts for copy, paste etc
- dragHandle is too high
- in TextComponent: different styling at click and removal of placeholder

## Test !!

0. Make a new test model
1. Test all functionality in model drawer
2. Test all functionality in tool bar
3. Also test the same on other languages

## Styling

- Make sure the primary and secondary colors are okay
- Make sure all coloring in the app depends on primary and secondary. Maybe even make a tertiary using shades of grey.
