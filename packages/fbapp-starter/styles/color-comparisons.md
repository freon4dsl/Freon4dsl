For your color choices, here are some recommendations based on how they compare:

1. **Consistency in Naming:**
    - Some variables use numbers that don't seem to follow a clear pattern (`dark1`, `dark10`, `dark18`, etc.).
    - If these represent shades from darkest to lightest, consider renaming them more systematically (e.g., `dark1` being the darkest, `dark25` being the lightest).

2. **Color Adjustments for Better Contrast:**
    - `darkslategray (#2F4F4F)` has a greenish tone—if you want a more neutral dark gray, consider `#333` instead.
    - `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` is great for overlays, but if you need better readability over backgrounds, try `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`.

3. **Duplicate Colors:**
    - `gray` and `grey` (`#808080`) are identical, so you might not need both.
    - `#666` (a medium gray) and `dimgray (#696969)` are very close—choosing just one could simplify your palette.
