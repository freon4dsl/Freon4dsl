# Changes made to core and core-svelte

On 19-08-22:
1. Created README in /editor
2. Name of PiActions changed into PiCombinedActions, to distinguish this interface from 
/editor/actions/PiAction. Caused changes in meta, and changes in CustomActions in samples and test.
3. Everything todo with triggers moved from PiActions/PiCombinedActions and PiAction to new file 
/editor/actions/PiTrigger.
4. Moved utils that are specific for the editor from /util to /editor/util, and extracted PiCaret class
from BehaviorUtils.ts. Removed implementation of setCaret in TextBox, because this is always overwritten.
5. Replaced use of 'keyCode' by 'key', only the test whether a character is printable remains to be done.
6. General cleanup of code.
7. Changed 'keyPressAction' to 'isCharAllowed' in TextBox.
8. Cleanup of PiEditor.
9. Merged in the temp changes in tree balancing.
